                <h2>Hi, I'm Pacamalan Nathaniel</h2>
                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi my friend! My name is Nathaniel, a dedicated web developer and designer located in Imus Cavite. Technology has always captivated me and influenced the world we live in. I started my web development journey by making my first website as a personal project, and ever since, I have focused on improving my skills and designing captivating web experiences.</p>
                <p>I believe that quality design should serve a purpose and be visually appealing. I use both creative skills and technical knowledge in my work to create user-friendly websites that are visually attractive. I have expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am always seeking new technologies and frameworks to enhance my skills.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy discovering fresh hiking paths, immersing myself in captivating books, or trying out new recipes in the kitchen. I am a firm supporter of continuous learning and enjoy taking part in online courses and workshops to maintain my skills.</p>
                <p>I'm always eager to collaborate on fresh projects, regardless of their size. If you want to get in touch, please don't hesitate to contact me via the contact page!</p>
                <p>And also I have personal experience in farming, like planting corn. It's tiring but enjoyable, especially when you're doing it with friends who are also planting.</p>
                <h3>My Personal experiences.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> <p>I have personal experience in farming when I was a kid, like planting corn. It's tiring but enjoyable, especially when you're doing it with friends who are also planting.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Planting corn was one of my wonderful experiences when I was in the province because you can learn valuable lessons from it. 
                        One lesson I picked up is that money isn't earned quickly, so you should use it wisely and properly, as you have to work hard for it before you can have it.</p></li>
                    <li><p><p>Based on my personal experience in the fields as a farmer, you cannot afford to be lazy because your earnings depend on your hard work.</p></p></li>
